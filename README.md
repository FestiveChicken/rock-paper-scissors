## 🧠 What I Learned
- Capturing **click events** on multiple buttons  
- Generating **random choices** for the computer opponent  
- Implementing **game logic** to compare choices and determine outcomes  
- Dynamically **updating the DOM** to show results and scores  
- Structuring code for **readability** and **separation of concerns**

## 📚 Assignment Summary
This project from The Odin Project’s Foundations curriculum guided me to:
1. Create buttons for “Rock,” “Paper,” and “Scissors.”  
2. Write a function to generate the computer’s random choice.  
3. Compare player and computer choices to decide a win, loss, or tie.  
4. Update and display scores after each round.  
5. Add a reset mechanism to clear scores and results.
